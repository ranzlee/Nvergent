Using NHibernate.Glimpse
-------------

1. Read the Glimpse readme.txt
2. (this should be automatic via NuGet's tranformation)

<system.web>

	  <!-- NHibernate.Glimpse 
	   [EXAMPLE NH CONFIG - just adapt to your own process if you use fluent or loquacious configurations...]
  
	  <hibernate-configuration xmlns="urn:nhibernate-configuration-2.2">
		<session-factory name="Default">
		  ...
	  
		  [VERIFY THESE SETTINGS FOR PROPER SQL FORMATTING]
		  <property name="show_sql">true</property>
		  <property name="format_sql">true</property>
		  ...
	  
		  [ADD THIS LISTENER FOR ENTITY LOAD STATISTICS]
		  <listener type="post-load" class="NHibernate.Glimpse.EntityPostLoadListener, NHibernate.Glimpse"/>

			NOTE: I've had mixed results with configuring the listener in the config, perhaps something has changed with NHibernate.
			As an alternate, you can do something like this in code:
			"config.SetListener(ListenerType.PostLoad, new EntityPostLoadListener());"
			The listener extends from the default post load listener.
		  ...

		  [ADD THIS PROPERTY FOR SESSION FACTORY STATISTICS]
		  <property name="generate_statistics">true</property>
	  
		</session-factory>
	  </hibernate-configuration>
	  -->

	...
	<appSettings>
		...
		<!-- NHibernate.Glimpse
		Alternately, you can configure in code like: "LoggerProvider.SetLoggersFactory(new LoggerFactory());"
		NOTE: IIS 7 does not allow access to HttpContext.Current in Application_Start, so if you're currently configuring
		your ISessionFactory there, you will get an error thrown "Request is not available in this context" in the 
		NHibernate.Glimpse logger.
	
		follow this process to work around this issue...
	  
		// in Global.asax
		void Application_BeginRequest(Object source, EventArgs e)
		{
			var app = (HttpApplication)source;
			var context = app.Context;
			// Attempt to peform first request initialization
			FirstRequestInitialization.Initialize(context);
		}

		//new class for one-time factory initialization
		class FirstRequestInitialization
		{
			private static bool _initializedAlready;
			private static readonly object Lock = new object();

			public static void Initialize(HttpContext context)
			{
				if (_initializedAlready)
				{
					return;
				}
				lock (Lock)
				{
					if (_initializedAlready) return;
					var config = new Cfg.Configuration();
					config.AddClass(typeof (Cat));
					
					//**IMPORTANT** - NHibernate.Glimpse stuff//

					//for entity load stats...
					config.SetListener(ListenerType.PostLoad, new NHibernate.Glimpse.EntityPostLoadListener());
					
					//for debug log - NOTE: setting the logger in appsettings does the same thing
					LoggerProvider.SetLoggersFactory(new NHibernate.Glimpse.LoggerFactory());
					
					//for non-persistent logging (i.e. per-request like the other Glimpse data)
					NHibernate.Glimpse.Plugin.KeepLogHistory = false;

					//build factory
					MvcApplication.SessionFactory = config.BuildSessionFactory();

					//for session factory stats
					NHibernate.Glimpse.Plugin.RegisterSessionFactory(MvcApplication.SessionFactory);

					//**//

					_initializedAlready = true;
				}
			}

3. If you would like additional statistics then use this simple API...

//after you build your factory - a one time call (process level) and thread safe
NHibernate.Glimpse.Plugin.RegisterSessionFactory(myISessionFactory);

4. If you would like Glimpse data to be transient (like other Glimpse data)

NHibernate.Glimpse.Plugin.KeepLogHistory = false;

5. Done.

More to come...

changes from 8.5
1. Added the ability to make log and SQL / entities loaded non-persistent (persistent logging has always been default and still is).

changes from 8.4
1. Added Session Factory statistics gathering

changes from 8.3
1. removed the config helper method.  I would prefer that the plugin components are registered with NH as you see fit...
2. additional minor bug fixes.
3. added the registration points for ISessionFactory and ISession, but we're not capturing statistics yet.
4. added the requirement to add the logger factory in app settings back in - we noticed some use cases where the programmatic
configuration would fail, but this seems seems bullet-proof (and follows the #1 philosophy)

changes from 8.2 (8.2 was a FAIL!)
1. fixed the relative path bug.
2. fixed the logger null reference exception.
3. trimmed the debug log to only show important session and DB activity - still tweaking...
4. removed the requirement to add the logger factory in app settings.
5. minor style tweaks.

changes from 8.1
1. fixed bug where cookie was attempted to be added to response after flush.
2. Added the per/request debug log infrastructure - more styling on this coming soon.

changes from 8.0
1. Removed the Log4Net dependency
2. Rolled own HttpContext aware log factory for NHibernate.
3. Stats are now accurate (although firing quick requests can show more than one entry, but the entry stats are correct). Still working on this.
4. Added handler for log details.
5. Removed all request locking.  The only potential locking is via the use of the concurrent dictionary in the plugin. However, all requests that are not glimpse requests are lock-free. So this plugin can be used in Production mode.
